naming convention:

p - pair non bonded
b - bond
a - angle
d - dihedral

i.e.
*_bad = run with bonds, angles and  dihedrals potentials


Dihedral Descriptions:

non-periodic: Harmonic dihedral centered at 0
across_boundary: harmonic dihedral center at +/- 180
periodic: Two well dihedral, centered at 0 and at +/- 180
